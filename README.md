i didnt fix the search yet, you can only search by first or last name but not by fullname.
also, the date of birth and time of birth are not separated and it is confusing for the users to read.
the cell is written as a tel, the loggin and location details dont have a header so you cant tell what is this data.
and of course it is ugly as fuck.
